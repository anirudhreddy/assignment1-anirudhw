                <h1> Jail Break!</h1>

                <p>You are in jail for Diamond Heist</p>
                <p>
                    You get a cake with a file in it as a gift from a corrupt cop looking for a share of the loot.
                    Night falls, and you start filing the bars on the window to escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You manage to make a hole big enough to sneak out of, you are now out of the Cell, and in the compound of the jail.
                    You notice that you're on a Island and North takes you into the Dense forest area and South goes to the water.
                </p>
                <p>Scary dense Forest or The freezing Cold waters?</p>
                <p><a href="#forest">Forest "Jungle Boogie!  ooh ooh! "</a></p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p><a href="#ocean">Ocean "In oceans deep, My faith will stand"</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!--Direction North -->
        <div id="forest" class="step slide" data-y="2500" data-x="7500">
            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>
                    You start running deep in to the jungle, it is so dense not a single ray of light hits the ground.
                    This is when you notice a few pairs of glistening eyes looking at you from a distance. Then you see Scantily clad men with spears and giant piercings all over their body made with sharpened bone. *Gasp*
                    If you get caught, you are a scrumptous meal, cause you aren't exactly on the healthy side, and could feed a small village.
                </p>
                <p>You could Try to out run them by going deep into the jungle, or you could say, F*ck this shit! and run the hell outta there and into the Deep blue sea</p>

                <p>Would you run into the forest? or Run for the waters?</p>
                <p><a href="forestrun.html">"Into the forest I go! Catch me if you can boys!"</a></p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p><a href="Oceanrun.html">"Sweet Sweet waters! Imma go swimming tonight!"</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Direction South -->
        <div id="ocean" class="step slide" data-y="3100" data-x="3500">
            <div class="slide-text">
                <p> You chicken out, and decide that the forest might not be a safe escape route, and decide to take the ocean route</p>
                <p>
                    You cannot run directly towards the ocean because you're still in the compund, you need to jump over the compund wall and risk being noticed.
                    or
                    You could run around to the other side of the jail, where there is a rumoured hole in the wall and you could sneak out.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>What do you do?!</p>
                <p><a href="jump.html">You decide that you no cannot not wait any longer to get outta that hellhole and you decide to jump</a></p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p><a href="sneak.html">Sneaking out seems like a way better option that risk being noticed by the guards</a></p>
